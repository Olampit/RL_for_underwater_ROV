[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/pcl/Modules/FindFLANN.cmake:45 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable FLANN_ROOT is set to:

    /usr

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.

  By not providing "FindStonefish.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "Stonefish", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Stonefish" with

  Add the installation prefix of "Stonefish" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Stonefish_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "Stonefish" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
